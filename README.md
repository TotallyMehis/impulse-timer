# Impulse Timer

Just some CS 1.6 timer plugin that lets you play with KZ, HL1 and Speedrun physics.

Only has Windows sigs for Orpheu so autobhop stuff won't work.


## Installation
- Install [latest dev version of Amx Mod X](https://www.amxmodx.org/downloads-new.php).
- Make sure sqlite module is enabled.
- Install [latest Orpheu](https://github.com/Arkshine/Orpheu/releases).
- If it's not working, check error log.


## Usage
- `/spawn` to go back to start.
- By default you can use commands `/kz`, `/speedrun` and `/hlkz` to change styles. `configs/impulse_styles.ini` to edit styles.
- Somewhat functioning voting (for some reason). `/rtv`, `/nominate <mapname>` commands in-game.
